# Beyond Average Scores: Identification of Consistent and Inconsistent Academic Achievement in Grouping Units

This project compares two approaches for identifying clustering units (schools) with unusual within-cluster variance:

- Spike-and-Slab Mixed-Effects Location Scale Model (SS-MELSM) implemented in ivd (via JAGS).

- Two-stage Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) following Raudenbush & Bryk (1987).

## Methods Summary

For each simulation condition, synthetic student test score data are generated for a specified number of schools and students per school. School-level residual variance is modeled with a mixture distribution: most schools are assigned to a spike component (baseline variance), and a proportion are assigned to a slab component (elevated variance). The magnitude of variance inflation in slab schools is controlled by a specified standard deviation on the log-scale. Data are analyzed using both the SS-MELSM and the two-stage HLM. Performance is evaluated in terms of true/false positives and negatives when flagging schools as unusually variable.
